Step 1:
Look for a comparable review to use as your base review. Ask Coen if you can't find any.

Step 2: 
Replace index information in the main function of the new index review, leave
area and area2 on "US" and "EU" and leave 'type', 'feed' and 'year' as is.

def run_frd4p_review(date, co_date, effective_date, index="FRD4P", isin="FRIX00003031", 
                    area="US", area2="EU", type="STOCK", universe="developed_market", 
                    feed="Reuters", currency="EUR", year=None):

Step 3:
replace all "frd4p" throughout the script with the index you will be making. Do this
in a case sensitive way. These are the basis for may files to be able to function.

Step 4:
Add to config.py in identical formatting:

    "FRD4P": {
        "index": "FRD4P",
        "isin": "FRIX00003031",
        "output_key": "frd4P_path"
    }

Also add to "ALL_MNEMOS" in the same config.py if not already there.(check this)

Step 5:
Add the review function to review_logic.py

    1. Import the review:
        from .reviews.frd4p_review import run_frd4p_review
    2. Add to REVIEW_FUNCTIONS dictionary

Step 6: 
Look for the following piece of code:
        symbols_filtered = stock_eod_df[
            stock_eod_df['#Symbol'].str.len() < 12
        ][['Isin Code', '#Symbol']].drop_duplicates(subset=['Isin Code'], keep='first')

For indices with RIC Codes: < 12
For indices with ISIN Codes: == 12
