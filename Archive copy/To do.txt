To do:
-   Check if the EICC runs based on the new afternoon file Check

Still to do for me:
Update the output folder to the daily folders dynamically
Make the file ready to be the basis fortea the EICC
Merge both scripts so the team only has to activate one script


Questions to the audience:
What extra checks do you think are valuable?
Do you think the comments explain the situation properly?
Should i keep the excluded values that we have now?

What I want you to do:



Add Index to the Summary Sheet
Include Dummys and Pro Forma's
