Restaurant Settles Federal Charges It Ignored Employees’ Reports of Sexual Harassment
SAMMAMISH, Wash. — Chipotle has agreed to pay $400,000 to three former crew members at its Sammamish, Washington, restaurant location, and will provide other relief to resolve a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency announced today.
According to the EEOC’s lawsuit, Chipotle permitted the three young crew members, including one who was only 17 years old at the time, to be harassed by their 29-year old service manager and subsequently by a 24-year old coworker. The harassment included the manager sexually assaulting the underaged employee and touching another worker’s buttocks. He also made unwelcome sexual comments and requests for sex, and isolated employees by trapping them in the restaurant’s walk-in refrigerator—blocking their exit—and caused them to fear for their safety. Despite the employees’ reports to the Sammamish restaurant’s general managers of being sexually harassed, Chipotle failed to adequately investigate their complaints and did not take adequate remedial measures to stop the sexual harassment.
Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which requires employers to investigate and take steps to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace. The EEOC filed its lawsuit (EEOC v. Chipotle Services, LLC and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., Case No. 2:22-cv-00279-RSL-MLP) in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington at Seattle after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process."" https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/chipotle-pay-400000-settle-eeoc-sexual-harassment-lawsuit"

The landmark ruling is being seen as underlining the importance of gender pay equality and sets a precedent for future claims. Ms Boyle initiated her claim against the US multinational in July 2018, after discovering significant pay discrepancies between herself and three male colleagues who were performing the same job.
[...] An employment tribunal overwhelmingly determined that Ms Boyle was indeed performing the same job as her male colleagues who were paid more and that the pay disparity was due to her being a woman. The employment judge concluded that the claimant was engaged in like work to her three male comparators, and any differences were not of practical importance un relation to the terms and conditions of employment. It said Caterpillar did not prove that the variation between Ms Boyle’s contract and those of her comparators “was genuinely due to a material factor which is not tainted by sex”.
[...] Consequently, she was awarded back pay for the period she was underpaid and ensured equal pay and benefits moving forward.
With interest added on from the outset of the tribunal, the total settlement came in at £305,719."" https://www.irishnews.com/news/business/belfast-woman-awarded-305000-in-historic-equal-pay-victory-U3XTHPXUPVHQPKFB4XOGIH2FTA/"
