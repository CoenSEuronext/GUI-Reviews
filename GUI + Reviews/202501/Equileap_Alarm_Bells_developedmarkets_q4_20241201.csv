The Tokyo District Court on May 13 ruled that a company’s housing system, which offers substantially better benefits to “career-track” employees, discriminates against women. The lawsuit was filed by a woman who works at AGC Green-Tech Co., a subsidiary of AGC Inc., which is a major glass manufacturer formerly called Asahi Glass Co. The woman claimed that she was subjected to gender discrimination by the company’s housing and wages policy based on the idea that “sogo-shoku” (career-track positions) are for men and “ippan-shoku” (general positions) are for women. The court ordered AGC Green-Tech to pay a total of 3.78 million yen ($24,250) to the woman, who is a general position employee. “There is no rational reason for limiting the company housing system to career-track employees,” the court said in the ruling. The court found that the situation “constitutes indirect discrimination” under the Equal Employment Opportunity Law and that “it is illegal for the company to continue to operate the company housing system without correcting the indirect discrimination.” According to the complaint and other documents, the Tokyo-based company’s career-track positions are almost exclusively occupied by men, while the general positions are almost exclusively held by women."" https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/15264795";

Microsoft reached a $14.4 million settlement with California’s Civil Rights Department to resolve claims that it discriminated and retaliated against women and disabled workers when they took protective leave.
The department said that, during its four-year investigation, it found that Microsoft gave lower bonuses and unfavorable performance reviews to workers who used protected leave, reducing their chances of getting promotions and stock awards. Protected leave gives workers rights to time off for pregnancy, disability, family care, and parental reasons without being retaliated against. 
[...] The overwhelming majority of the settlement — $14.2 million — will be paid as direct relief to Microsoft workers in California who were impacted by the alleged issue between 2017 and 2024. Microsoft also committed to taking “range of proactive steps to prevent future discrimination,” CRD said. That includes more training for managers over workers’ rights to protected leave and hiring an independent consultant every year to assess whether it’s complying with the terms of the settlement, among others."" https://qz.com/microsoft-settle-14-million-disability-discrimination-c-1851575836

Ms Boyle initiated her claim against the US multinational in July 2018, after discovering significant pay discrepancies between herself and three male colleagues who were performing the same job.
[...] An employment tribunal overwhelmingly determined that Ms Boyle was indeed performing the same job as her male colleagues who were paid more and that the pay disparity was due to her being a woman. The employment judge concluded that the claimant was engaged in like work to her three male comparators, and any differences were not of practical importance un relation to the terms and conditions of employment. It said Caterpillar did not prove that the variation between Ms Boyle’s contract and those of her comparators “was genuinely due to a material factor which is not tainted by sex”.
[...] Consequently, she was awarded back pay for the period she was underpaid and ensured equal pay and benefits moving forward.

The employment tribunal ruling will benefit 3,540 claimants, who accused Next of paying its retail sales staff – who are overwhelmingly female – lower hourly wages than its warehouse workers, the majority of which are male. Next – which has 466 stores across the UK – had argued that the difference in pay for the two roles was based on the “market rate” for each position, and reflected the need to recruit and retain 24/7 staffing of warehouses, including for night shifts, Sundays and public holidays.
