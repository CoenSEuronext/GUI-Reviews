- Comma issue in Stock file
- See how francesco creates the golden source and see i can find a way to do that independently
- Maybe refer to the nth column instead of the hard column name - names may change over time.

- Add fillna(10000) to selection_df



--> What needs to be fixed the selection needs to be selected based on the ranking and after that be alphabetically ordered.
